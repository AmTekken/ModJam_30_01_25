This mod includes a custom asset called the Echo Device, an Off-hand utility item which gives the wielder the possibility to go back in time through the echo state. In this state you are able to go past the rubbles of the current time, or walk through bridges long destroyed. Once finished your body will travel to the echo's location.

The Echo Device can be used by right-clicking and holding until charged.
The Echo State is 5 seconds long, and the channeling to go to the echo location is 0.5 seconds
During Echo State you will not have your player's inventory, however you are quicker and jump higher.
The Echo State gives you the possibility to see certain blocks called The Echo Blocks (currently there are 2 variants)
The Echo State also freezes all NPCs during it's duration, so you can use this to escape large mobs, or position yourself better.

To demonstrate the device, puzzles stand between you and chests gearing up the player to challenge the Skeletal Master deep inside.
Let us know how many hidden rooms you manage to find!

The zip file contains a single player save file which you just paste on the Saves folder of the Userdata, everything is set up!

This mod was made by AmTekken, The Architect and Krayts from the Darktale Team.
